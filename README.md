Social-Authority-Hovercard
==========================

A Chrome extension that, on mouse over, reveals any referenced Twitter user's Social Authority.

To use, download the zip. Then go to Chrome and type in the address bar `chrome://extensions/`. Make sure to check the `Developer Mode` in the top right corner. Then, click `Load unpacked extension` and choose the unzipped directory.

Then, to try it out, go to a page with a lot of Twitter handles. But not Twitter.com (as they handle their handles in a highly complex manner). Mouse over and you will see some fun scores!
