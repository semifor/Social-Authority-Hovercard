Social Authority Hovercard
==========================

*Note: this is a very quick and dirty example use of the [Social Authority
API](http://followerwonk.com/social-authority).  It does not work on all pages.
We plan to update this from time to time with
new things. Keep checking back.*

This Chrome extension, on mouse over, reveals any referenced Twitter user's
Social Authority.

To use:

1. [Get your API credentials!](http://followerwonk.com/social-authority)
1. Download the zip
2. Edit the source code of TwitterUsers.js and enter your API credentials where
noted
3. Then go to Chrome and type in the address bar `chrome://extensions/`
4. Make sure to check `Developer Mode` in the top right corner
5. Then, click `Load unpacked extension` and choose the unzipped directory

Then, to try it out, go to a page with a lot of Twitter handles. But not
Twitter.com (as they handle their handles in a highly complex manner). Mouse
over and you will see some fun scores!
